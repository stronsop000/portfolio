## Overview

Sandfalling Game is a touch-friendly falling-sand simulation featuring realistic particle interactions between different materials like sand, water, oil, and fire. Built with Next.js and Canvas/WebGL, it delivers smooth performance across desktop and mobile devices while demonstrating advanced physics simulation techniques.

The primary purpose of this app is to:

- Create an engaging physics simulation with realistic particle behavior
- Demonstrate performance optimization for canvas-based applications
- Provide cross-platform compatibility for desktop and mobile devices
- Showcase interactive simulation development using modern web technologies
