## Overview

Finance Arcade is a website I created to make learning finance principles more accessible, simple, and fun. Instead of overwhelming jargon, the site breaks down core concepts into easy-to-understand lessons, giving students and beginners the tools to approach finance with confidence.

The primary purpose of this app is to:

- Make finance education accessible and engaging for beginners
- Break down complex financial concepts into digestible lessons
- Provide a fun, interactive learning experience
- Help students and young professionals build financial literacy
